Keras: 
•	Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow. 
•	Keras is high Level API(Application Programmable Interface) that allow to build the Deep learning or Machine Learning models easily. 
•	The Keras library provides a convenient wrapper for deep learning models to be used as classification or regression estimators in scikit-learn.

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model thatcan predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 
OVERALL GOAL: Get an understanding for which variables are important, view summary statistics, and visualize the data.
